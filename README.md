Telecommunication Trade union website
=====================================

Trade unions are created either nationally or internaltionally to help workers in a certain fiield get help and also have a community.We noticed there are very few countries which have national telecom trade unions websites. So my team mates and i decide to build a telecommunication trade Union website. This would help graduates and even workers in the telecom filed connect, help and grow with each other.
