Telecommunication Trade Union website
=====================================

Trade unions are created either nationally or internationally to help workers in a certain field get help and also have a community. We noticed there are very few countries that have national telecom trade union websites. So my teammates and I decided to build a telecommunication trade Union website. This would help graduates and even workers in the telecom field connect, help, and grow with each other.

* Open the command line and type `python --version`

    if you see a line similar to this `Python 3.11.5` then you have python installed in your machine 

    if not head to the [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website and download python.

    `Note:` Python versions from Python 2.7. 9+ and Python 3.4+ when installed comes with `pip`
